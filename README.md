# asdf-parse-tool-versions

Parses asdf [.tool-versions](http://asdf-vm.com/manage/configuration.html#tool-versions) file extracting version information.

Returns a JSON string as output with this format: 

```
{"golang":"1.12.5","ruby":"2.7.0"}
```

Each tool has it's own key where value is the value in the `.tool-versions` file.

The action also exports all versions as environment variables with the format `<tool>_VERSION` (i.e. `GOLANG_VERSION`).

Please note that _hyphens_ in names are replaced with _underscores_ (i.e. `golanci-lint` becomes `golangci_lint` and `GOLANGCI_LINT_VERSION`). This is necessary to support tool names with hyphens, as otherwise they would break both the JSON and the environment variable syntaxes.

## Usage

```yaml

      - name: gather versions
        uses: endorama/asdf-parse-tool-versions@v1
        id: versions

      - name: install Go
        uses: actions/setup-go@v1
        with: 
          go-version: "${{ env.GOLANG_VERSION }}"

      # OR using action output
      - name: install Go
        uses: actions/setup-go@v1
        with: 
          go-version: ${{ fromJSON(steps.versions.outputs.tools).golang }}
